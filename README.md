Horiseon SEO - Semantic HTML Project
https://barnes-malcolm.github.io/horiseon-html/

The goal of the project was to optimize legacy HTML into Semantic HTML. In order to appear more semantic to search engines and inrease accessibility the visually impaired, the website's HTML tags were updated to the latest version HTML5 tags. I optimized the code to show how semantic HTML should be layed out and the increase the visibility of its elements with regard to search and images.
